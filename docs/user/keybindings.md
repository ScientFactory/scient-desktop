# Keybindings

Edit keybindings from **Settings** → **Keybindings**. That page lists every command, its current
shortcut, whether it is a default or your own, and warns about conflicts.

Use **Open keybindings.json** on the settings page when you prefer to edit the
file directly; that always opens the authoritative file for the selected
environment. A production desktop environment normally stores it at
`~/.scient-next/userdata/keybindings.json`. A separately launched compatible
server may use another configured base directory, including the inherited
`~/.t3/userdata/` default. These path names are compatibility values, not a
different product or a reason to copy configuration between environments.

Scient writes the built-in defaults into the environment's file on first run
and adds new defaults on later startups unless one of your rules already claims
the command or shortcut.

The file is a JSON array of rules.

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+g", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+g", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" }
]
```

Invalid rules are ignored. An invalid file is ignored entirely, and the server logs a warning.

## Rule Shape

- `key` (required): shortcut string, like `mod+j`, `ctrl+k`, `cmd+shift+d`
- `command` (required): the command ID to run
- `when` (optional): boolean expression controlling when the shortcut is active

## Key Syntax

Modifiers: `mod` (`cmd` on macOS, `ctrl` elsewhere), `cmd` / `meta`, `ctrl` / `control`, `shift`,
`alt` / `option`.

Examples: `mod+j`, `mod+shift+d`, `ctrl+l`, `cmd+k`.

## Commands

Commands are IDs like `terminal.toggle`, `commandPalette.toggle`, `preview.refresh`, and
`chat.new`. Project scripts are addressable as `script.{id}.run`, for example `script.test.run`.

`filePicker.toggle` opens file search for the active project and defaults to `mod+p`.
`projectSearch.toggle` searches inside the active project's files and defaults to `mod+shift+f`.
Repeating either shortcut closes that search, and switching shortcuts replaces the open search.
`themeEditor.toggle` opens or closes the floating theme editor and defaults to
`mod+alt+shift+t`. Select a color label to spotlight the elements that use it; select the label
again to clear the spotlight. The swatch and hex field keep that color selected while you edit it.
Advanced mode groups related app tokens into a smaller set of color families. Changing a family
updates its paired text and interaction states while leaving every unrelated imported color intact.
Use **Inspect** to pick an element in the app and reveal its color token. Inspect disarms after one
successful pick; its hover glow and badge preview the element and color family that click will select.
**Cancel** or `Escape` exits Inspect and clears its selection and spotlight.

`rightPanel.toggleMaximized` maximizes or restores the open right panel. It has no default shortcut,
so add one in **Settings** → **Keybindings** if you want to use it.

`thread.settle` settles the active thread or restores it when it is already settled. Its default
shortcut is `mod+shift+s`, and it does not run while the terminal has focus.

The command palette searches active thread titles, projects, branches, user messages, and final
agent responses across connected environments. Message matches show one labeled excerpt while
keeping the thread's project, branch, and machine context visible. Message search begins after two
characters and uses SQLite's ASCII case-insensitive matching.

The full command list and the current defaults are shown in **Settings** → **Keybindings**, which
always matches the build you are running. Use that rather than a copied list.

Note that `chat.new` and `chat.newLocal` both create a thread through the same path. A new thread
inherits the project you were in, along with model and mode selections. Branch, worktree, and
environment mode always come from your configured defaults, not from the thread you were looking
at. To keep a worktree, use the explicit "new thread in this worktree" action in the branch
toolbar. The only difference between the two commands: with the current sidebar and more than one
project, `chat.new` opens a project chooser first.

Background submission from a new thread is the exception. `mod+enter` starts that thread and opens
another new thread with the same workspace mode and base branch. **New worktree** remains selected,
but the new thread does not reuse the worktree created for the thread that just started.

## `when` Conditions

A `when` expression is evaluated against context keys describing the current UI state. The keys
the app supplies today are `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`, `previewOpen`, and
`modelPickerOpen`. The set is open and grows over time, so treat that as the current list rather
than a fixed one. Any key the running app does not supply evaluates to `false`.

Operators: `!` (not), `&&` (and), `||` (or), and parentheses.

Examples:

- `"when": "terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "terminalOpen && !terminalFocus"`
- `"when": "!terminalFocus"`

## Precedence

- Rules are evaluated in array order.
- For a key event, the last rule where both `key` matches and `when` evaluates to `true` wins.
- Precedence is across commands, not only within the same command. A later rule for a different
  command can take a key away from an earlier one.
