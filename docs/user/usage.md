# Review usage

Use the Usage page to understand which providers and models are doing the work,
compare activity over time, and estimate the token cost of recent project work.
It is an activity view, not an invoice.

The Usage page combines Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build activity from your connected
environments. It reads the providers' local session history and shows API-equivalent token cost,
processed tokens, cache savings, provider shares, and model breakdowns. Subscription billing is
separate from the raw token cost shown here.

The scan happens inside each connected environment. Raw transcript records stay there; only
summarized time, provider, model, token, and cost totals—plus whether each
source could be read—are sent to the client.
This page is separate from Scient product analytics and telemetry, and it does not query a provider
billing API.

Cost is an estimate with explicit provenance. A saved custom price takes precedence. Otherwise,
Scient uses a cost reported in the transcript when one exists, or prices a recognized model with
the public LiteLLM model rate table. Tokens from
an unrecognized model remain in token totals but add no estimated cost. Scient refreshes the rate
table at most daily and can use its cached copy offline; without either copy, affected records are
shown as unpriced rather than guessed.

A Grok turn appears only after the provider writes a completed usage record.
Unfinished turns may not appear.

On web and desktop, filter costs, tokens, and limits with the environment dropdown. All environments
are initially selected. Results appear as each environment responds, with scanning status shown
for those still loading.

## Set custom model prices

On web or desktop, open the environment dropdown on **Usage**, then choose **Model prices** to add,
edit, or reset a model's estimated price. **Apply to** starts with your current Usage filter;
choose all environments or select individual destinations. Enter the exact model ID and USD
rates per million input and output tokens. You can enter any model ID, including models
without public pricing.

Cache read and cache write rates are optional and use the input rate when blank. Enter `0` for
tokens that are free. Saved prices replace automatic pricing for all of that environment's
history and are shared with clients connected to it. When environments have different prices,
cells show **Mixed**. Edit rates directly in the table, then choose **Save changes** to apply all
edited rows. Untouched cells keep each environment's rate. Select one environment to inspect its
prices. **Reset to automatic** marks a model's override for removal when you save; you can undo
it before saving.

Each destination reports whether the change saved. Offline or unavailable environments are
marked **Not saved**. Reconnect them and choose **Retry failed saves** to finish the same change
without writing again to environments that already saved. Changes are not queued after you close
the dialog.

## Check subscription limits

**Usage → Limits** pools every subscription account it can see per provider, so with several Codex
or Claude accounts across your environments and hubs you read one number per window rather than a
list. Each window card shows how much of the pool is left and a bar with one segment per account,
ordered by which resets soonest; when the provider reports reset times, the card also says when
the next reset lands and how much it hands back. The hatched
part of a segment is what that reset restores. Tap a segment or account row for the account's plan,
where it is signed in, and its reset time. On web, you can hover too. Codex accounts with banked
reset credits show a ticket count and the **Use reset** action in the account details. On narrow screens, numbered rows below
the bar show each account's quota, countdown, and credits. Tap a row to open its details.

The same account signed in on more than one environment, or reported by a hub as well, counts once.
Filter with the environment dropdown to see what a single machine has.

If a window looks stale, refresh Limits to re-check every provider and hub.

Pick `/usage-limits` from the composer's command menu, or send it as a message, to check the
current model's limits without leaving the conversation. The result opens above the composer and
closes when you dismiss it or send your next message. It uses the same snapshot as **Usage → Limits**, so it does not run the agent or refresh
anything. The command is offered only for providers that appear under **Usage → Limits**.

API-key accounts may not report subscription limits. This also applies to Claude connections
using a proxy through `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Connect a CLIProxyAPI hub

To see pooled accounts, open **Settings → Providers → Usage providers → Add hub**. Choose the
environment that will connect to the hub and enter its URL and management key.

The accounts appear under **Usage → Limits**. This connection supplies usage information; configure
the provider separately to send agent requests through the hub. Remove the hub from the same
settings section when you no longer need it.

If a directly connected provider reports limits for the same provider and email, its row replaces
the hub copy and retains details such as banked reset credits. The hub remains visible when the
provider cannot report limits. Management keys stay on the server and are not returned to clients.
Account emails follow your privacy setting.

Use **Past 24h** for an hourly chart covering the exact rolling 24-hour period. The **7 days**,
**30 days**, and **90 days** ranges use daily resolution. Cost and token toggles update both the
headline and chart. Refreshing rescans every connected environment and refetches model pricing on
each of them, so a newly released model that showed $0.00 gets a price without waiting for the daily
pricing update.
